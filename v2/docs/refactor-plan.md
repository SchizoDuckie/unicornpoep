# Refactoring Plan: Towards an Event-Based System

1.  **Problem:** The current JavaScript codebase exhibits tight coupling between components. Major parts like `MultiplayerGame`, `Game`, `MainMenu`, `WebRTCManager`, and various UI controllers (`multiplayer-controller`, `gamearea-controller`, `dialog-controller`, etc.) have direct dependencies on each other, often through a central `MainMenu` object acting as a service locator or by direct instantiation and method calls. This makes the code:
    *   **Hard to Understand:** Following the flow of execution requires jumping between many tightly linked files.
    *   **Brittle:** Changes in one component (e.g., a UI controller) can easily break another component that depends on it directly (e.g., `MultiplayerGame`).
    *   **Difficult to Test:** Isolating components for unit testing is challenging due to these direct dependencies.
    *   **Difficult to Extend:** Adding new features often requires modifying multiple existing components.

2.  **Goal:** Refactor the codebase to use an event-based architecture. Components will communicate indirectly by emitting events and listening for events they care about, rather than calling methods on each other directly. This will:
    *   **Decouple Components:** Reduce direct dependencies, making components more independent and reusable.
    *   **Improve Maintainability:** Changes within one component are less likely to affect others.
    *   **Enhance Testability:** Components can be tested in isolation by mocking the event bus or dispatching test events.
    *   **Increase Clarity:** Interactions become clearer â€“ component A *emits* an event, component B *listens* for it.

3.  **Development Strategy: `v2` Subdirectory**

    *   **Isolation:** To avoid disrupting the current working application, the entire refactor will take place within a new subdirectory named `v2`.
    *   **Self-Contained Environment:** The `v2` directory will be self-contained.
        *   **HTML:** Duplicate the main `index.html` into `v2/index.html`.
        *   **Assets:** Copy necessary asset directories (e.g., `css/`, `js/lib/`, `images/`, `fonts/`) from the root directory into the `v2` directory.
        *   **Path Adjustments:** Modify all paths within `v2/index.html` (for CSS, JS, images) and within copied assets (like CSS `url()` paths) to use relative paths that correctly point to resources *within* the `v2` directory structure. This ensures `v2` runs independently.
    *   **Benefit:** This approach allows side-by-side comparison of the original and refactored code and enables independent testing of the `v2` version by serving `v2/index.html`.
    *   **Mandatory V2 Code Verification:** Before implementing or modifying *any* component, service, or utility within the `v2` directory based on this plan, the developer **MUST** first check if a corresponding file already exists in the `v2/js/...` structure. If a V2 file exists, its current implementation **MUST** be read, understood, and used as the basis for any changes. **DO NOT** overwrite existing V2 code without review. If V1 code exists but no V2 code does, use V1 as a reference for refactoring into the V2 structure. If unsure, ask.

4.  **Proposed Solution: Event Bus & Component-Based UI**

    *   **Event Bus:** Implement a simple event bus/emitter class with `on(eventName, listener)`, `off(eventName, listener)`, and `emit(eventName, ...args)` methods.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use ES Modules (`import/export`). Create a single instance of `EventBus` in `event-bus.js` and export it. Other modules can then explicitly `import eventBus from './event-bus.js';`. This makes dependencies clearer and avoids polluting the global scope.

        ```javascript
        // Example: event-bus.js - ES Module Singleton
        class EventBus {
            constructor() { this.listeners = {}; }
            on(eventName, callback) { /* ... add listener ... */ console.debug(`EventBus: Listener added for '${eventName}'`); }
            off(eventName, callback) { /* ... remove listener ... */ console.debug(`EventBus: Listener removed for '${eventName}'`); }
            emit(eventName, ...args) {
                console.debug(`[EventBus] Emitting: '${eventName}'`, args);
                (this.listeners[eventName] || []).forEach(callback => {
                    try {
                        callback(...args);
                    } catch (error) {
                        console.error(`[EventBus] Error in listener for '${eventName}':`, error);
                        // Optionally emit a system error event here
                        // this.emit(Events.System.ErrorOccurred, { message: `Listener error for ${eventName}`, error });
                    }
                });
            }
        }
        const eventBus = new EventBus(); // Singleton instance
        export default eventBus;
        ```

    *   **Hierarchical Event Constants:** Define all possible event names as constants within a structured object.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Similar to the `EventBus`, export the `Events` object from `event-constants.js` and import it where needed.
        *   **Payload Definition (CRITICAL):** *Rigorously define and document the exact payload structure for every event.* Use JSDoc comments above each event constant definition in `event-constants.js` to specify the type and properties of the payload. This is essential for maintainability and acts as a contract between emitters and listeners.

        ```javascript
        // Example: event-constants.js
        /**
         * Core application events namespace.
         * @namespace Events
         */
        export const Events = {
            /**

        *   **Specialized Components (Examples):** Classes like `MainMenuComponent`, `PlayerListComponent`, `QuestionDisplayComponent` will extend `BaseComponent` to manage standard UI sections. Dialog classes like `NamePromptDialog`, `SinglePlayerEndDialog`, `MultiplayerEndDialog` will extend `BaseDialog` to manage modal dialogs. They will define their own HTML element selector, listen for specific application events, and update their respective DOM sections.
        *   **`UIManager`:** Instantiates the required components (both `BaseComponent` views and `BaseDialog` dialogs). It listens for high-level navigation events like `Events.Navigation.ShowView` to manage which VIEW components are active, hiding others. Dialogs are typically shown/hidden based on game state events (e.g., `Game.Finished`) or specific programmatic calls (e.g., `NamePromptDialog.prompt()`).
    *   **New UI Components (Replacing Old Controllers/Dialogs):** The following components will be created to handle specific UI sections and interactions:
        *   `MainMenuComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#mainMenu`.
        *   `SheetSelectionComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#sheetSelection`.
        *   `QuestionDisplayComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#question`.
        *   `AnswerListComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#answers`.
            *   **(Note:** Implementation added basic keyboard navigation (arrow keys/enter/space) for accessibility.)*
        *   `TimerDisplayComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#timer`.
        *   `ScoreDisplayComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#score` (SP) / `#playerScores` (MP placeholder).
        *   `ProgressDisplayComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#progressIndicator`.
            *   **(Note:** Implementation added updating a visual `<progress>` bar alongside text.)*
        *   `GameNavigationComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#gameNavigation`/`#stopGame`.
        *   `GameFeedbackComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Handles answer highlighting/confetti (on correct answer).
        *   `CountdownComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#countdownDisplay`.
        *   `MultiplayerChoiceComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#multiplayerChoice`.
        *   `HostLobbyComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages host waiting screen (`#connectionCode`), displays code/link, player count/names, copy/share buttons, handles start button click.
        *   `JoinLobbyComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages join screens (`#joinView`, `#fetchingInfoView`, `#joinConfirmView`, `#waitingForStartView`), handles code input/submit, displays game info, handles confirm/cancel clicks.
        *   `PlayerListComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages a dedicated player list display (e.g., `#playerListContainer`) shown in MP lobby and game area. Listens for `PlayerListUpdated`, `PlayerUpdated`. Shows player names, scores, finished status.
        *   `HighscoresComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#highscores`, listens for `Highscores.Loaded`, renders list, handles back button.
        *   `CustomQuestionsComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#customQuestionsManager`, emits save/delete events, handles back button.
        *   `AboutComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#about`, handles back button.
        *   `LoadingComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#loading`, listens for loading start/finish events.
        *   Dialog Components (extending `BaseDialog`):
            *   `NamePromptDialog`: Manages `#namePromptDialog`.
            *   `SinglePlayerEndDialog`: Manages `#endOfGameDialog`.
                *   **(Note:** Implementation added `Events.System.ShowFeedback` emission on empty name save attempt.)*
            *   `MultiplayerEndDialog`: Manages `#multiplayerEndDialog`.
            *   `PracticeEndDialog`: Manages `#practiceEndDialog`.
            *   `DisconnectionDialog`: Manages `#disconnectionDialog`.
            *   `ErrorDialog`: Manages `#errorDialog`.
        *   `ToastComponent` (extends `BaseComponent`): Manages `#toastNotification`.
        *   **Application Initialization (`UnicornPoep`):** A dedicated class or entry-point script (`UnicornPoep.js` or similar) responsible *only* for the initial setup:
            *   Instantiate core singleton services: `EventBus`, `UIManager`, `QuestionsManager`, `HighscoreManager`, `WebRTCManager` (and potentially others like a `ConfigurationLoader`).
            *   Initialize the `UIManager` (which internally creates its managed UI components and dialogs).
            *   Trigger the display of the initial view (e.g., `eventBus.emit(Events.Navigation.ShowView, { viewName: 'MainMenu' });`).
            *   **Crucially, it does *not* directly handle UI interaction events for starting games.** That logic belongs elsewhere (see Step 5).
            *   **Ensure the local `v2/js/lib/peerjs.min.js` is used.** Do not rely on external CDNs for PeerJS. Verify that `v2/index.html` correctly references this local file.
            *   **(Added Requirement):** The `v2/js/services/WebRTCManager.js` **MUST** implement robust heartbeat mechanisms (e.g., sending periodic pings) and timeout detection logic for client connections (on the host) and the host connection (on the client) to handle silent disconnections gracefully, similar to the functionality present in the V1 codebase.

    *   **Architectural Principle: Avoid Defensive Programming (Mandatory):**
        *   **Trust the Setup:** Components (especially those extending `BaseComponent` or `BaseDialog`) should trust that their `rootElement` exists after the superclass constructor runs. The `BaseComponent` constructor *must* throw an error if the root element cannot be found.
        *   **Child Element Validation:** When querying essential child elements within a component's constructor (e.g., buttons, input fields, display areas critical for functionality), the constructor *must* check if these elements were found. If any essential child element is missing, the constructor *must* `throw new Error(...)` immediately, clearly indicating the missing element(s) and the component that requires them. Do *not* use flags (like `isFunctional`) or return early to silently handle missing elements.
        *   **No Redundant Checks:** Subsequent methods within the component (e.g., event handlers, `show`, `hide`, `destroy`, `_removeEventListeners`) should *not* re-check for the existence of the root element or essential child elements whose presence was already verified (or guaranteed by throwing an error) in the constructor. Avoid unnecessary `if (this.element)` checks or optional chaining (`.`) on elements confirmed during construction.
        *   **Exception: Event Payloads/External Data:** Defensive checks (like `payload.property` or `typeof data === 'expectedType'`) *are* appropriate and necessary when handling data from external sources like event payloads or API responses, where the structure is not guaranteed at compile time.

    *   **Architectural Principle: UI Event Decoupling (Mandatory):**
        *   **UI Components** are responsible ONLY for capturing user interactions and emitting corresponding `Events.UI.*` events with the necessary payload.
        *   **Service Classes** (e.g., `QuestionsManager`, `HighscoreManager`, `WebRTCManager`, `QuizEngine`) should NEVER directly listen for `Events.UI.*` events.
        *   **Coordinator Services** (e.g., `GameCoordinator`, a potential `MenuCoordinator` or similar) are responsible for listening to relevant `Events.UI.*` events.
        *   Upon receiving a UI event, the **Coordinator** validates the request (if necessary), calls the appropriate method(s) on the relevant **Service Class(es)**, and then emits feedback events (`Events.System.ShowFeedback`, `Events.System.ErrorOccurred`) or domain-specific events (e.g., `Events.Menu.CustomQuestions.SaveSuccess`, `Events.Game.Started`) based on the outcome of the service call.
        *   This maintains a clear separation of concerns: UI signals intent, Coordinator orchestrates the action, Service performs the core logic/data manipulation.
        *   **Asset Management:** Ensure all necessary assets (CSS, JS libraries like `peerjs.min.js`, images, fonts) are correctly copied into the `v2` structure and placed in appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `v2/fonts/`, `v2/js/lib/`). Avoid copying unused V1 assets. **Verify that all required CSS from V1, including potentially separate files like `mobile.css`, is either integrated into `v2/css/styles.css` or copied to `v2/css/` and correctly referenced in `v2/index.html`.**

    *   **UI Pattern: Use `<template>` for Repeating Elements (Recommended):** When dynamically generating lists or other repeating structures within UI components (e.g., player lists, high score lists, custom sheet lists), prefer using the HTML `<template>` element. Define the structure of a single item within the `<template>` tag in your HTML file. In the component's JavaScript, query for the template, clone its `content` (`template.content.cloneNode(true)`), populate the clone with data, and then append the clone to the container. This is generally more performant and maintainable than numerous `document.createElement` calls.

    *   **Verification Against V1:** When implementing features or refactoring logic (especially UI structure, data handling, core game rules), **always attempt to verify assumptions and implementation details against the original V1 codebase (`/js`, `/css`, `index.html`) where applicable.** While the goal is improvement and decoupling, preserving existing *intended* functionality and structure (unless explicitly decided otherwise) is crucial. Use V1 as a reference to avoid accidentally dropping features or misinterpreting requirements during the refactor.

    *   **Progress Tracking:** Maintain a separate `refactor-progress.md` file in the workspace root. After completing significant steps or sections of the refactoring, update this file to reflect the current status, including which components/services have been refactored, adherence to the plan, and any deviations or pending items. This provides a clear overview of the refactoring progress.
    *   **(New Goal) Translation Refactoring:** Alongside the event-based architecture, refactor the application to facilitate easy translation by moving all user-facing strings into `v2/index.html`. See `translation-plan.md` for details.

5.  **Refactoring Steps:**

    *   **Step 0: Setup `v2` Directory:**
        *   Create the `v2/` subdirectory.
        *   Duplicate `index.html` to `v2/index.html`.
        *   Copy required asset folders (e.g., `css`, `js/lib`, `images`) into `v2/`. **Ensure all necessary V1 CSS files (including `mobile.css` if used) are copied or integrated.**
        *   Adjust all paths within `v2/index.html` and copied assets (CSS `url()`) to be relative to the `v2` directory. **Verify `v2/index.html` uses the local `js/lib/peerjs.min.js`.**
    *   **Step 1: Implement Core Infrastructure (within `v2/js/`):**
        *   Create `v2/js/core/event-bus.js` (singleton export), `v2/js/core/event-constants.js` (export `Events` with JSDoc payloads), `v2/js/components/base-component.js`.
        *   Create structure for services like `v2/js/services/QuizEngine.js`, `v2/js/services/QuestionsManager.js`, `v2/js/services/HighscoreManager.js`, `v2/js/services/WebRTCManager.js`, `v2/js/ui/UIManager.js`. Define interfaces/expected methods.
    *   **Step 2: Implement Application Initialization & Game Coordination (within `v2/js/`):**
        *   Create `v2/js/UnicornPoep.js` (or `v2/js/main.js` / `v2/js/app.js`) for core service instantiation and initial view trigger as described above.
        *   **Game Mode Instantiation & Coordination:** Introduce a dedicated `GameCoordinator.js` service responsible for coordinating the start of different game modes.
            *   The `GameCoordinator` listens for relevant UI events (e.g., `Events.UI.MainMenu.StartSinglePlayerClicked`, `Events.UI.MultiplayerChoice.HostClicked`, `Events.UI.JoinLobby.SubmitCodeClicked`). **It MUST NOT be handled by UI components or core game/data services directly.**
            *   Upon receiving such an event, it performs necessary validation and orchestrates interactions with other services (e.g., `WebRTCManager`, `QuestionsManager`).
            *   If valid, it instantiates the appropriate game mode class (`SinglePlayerGame`, `MultiplayerGame`, `PracticeGame`) or emits further events as needed.
            *   Handles the overall game start/setup flow triggered by user actions.
        *   **Menu Action Coordination (Mandatory):** Similarly, UI events related to non-game actions (like saving custom questions: `Events.UI.CustomQuestions.SaveClicked`, deleting sheets, loading high scores: `Events.Menu.Highscores.ShowRequested`) **MUST** be handled by a dedicated Coordinator (e.g., a new `MenuCoordinator` or potentially integrated into `UIManager` or the main `UnicornPoep` initializer if simple) rather than directly by the target service (`QuestionsManager`, `HighscoreManager`). This Coordinator will call the service methods and emit feedback/result events.
    *   **Step 3: Create Core UI Components:**
        *   Refactor `MainMenu` into `MainMenuComponent.js` extending `BaseComponent`. Implement its UI event emissions (`Events.UI.MainMenu.*`).
        *   Create other essential UI components (`PlayerListComponent`, `QuestionDisplayComponent`, `ScoreboardComponent`, Dialog components like `NamePromptComponent`, `EndGameComponent`, etc.) extending `BaseComponent`, managed by `UIManager`.
        *   Implement basic view switching in `UIManager` listening to `Events.Navigation.ShowView`.
    *   **Step 4: Implement `QuizEngine` & Game Mode Classes:**
        *   Flesh out `QuizEngine.js` with core quiz logic (question loading/serving, answer checking).
        *   Create and implement the structure for `SinglePlayerGame.js`, `PracticeGame.js`, `MultiplayerGame.js`. They should instantiate `QuizEngine`, listen for relevant UI events (like `AnswerSubmitted`), interact with `QuizEngine`, manage mode-specific elements (timers, WebRTC via its manager), and emit `Events.Game.Finished`.
        *   **Refinement Note:** If significant duplication arises between `SinglePlayerGame.js` and `PracticeGame.js` (or other future modes), consider introducing a `BaseGameMode.js` class to contain common game flow logic (start, nextQuestion, finish, basic event handling), keeping `QuizEngine` focused solely on quiz mechanics (question data, answer checking, progress). The specific game mode classes would then extend `BaseGameMode` and implement mode-specific features (timers, scoring, networking).
    *   **Step 5: Refactor Event Producers:**
        *   Modify remaining classes (`WebRTCManager`, `Timer`, dialog components, input handlers) and the Game Mode classes to `emit`
    *   **Step 6: Refactor Remaining UI Controllers/Logic:**
    *   **Step 7: Integration & Testing:**
    *   **Step 8: Cleanup & Documentation:**
