# Refactoring Progress (Component-Driven Architecture)

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the UnicornPoep codebase towards the component-driven architecture outlined in `refactor-plan.mdc`.

**Overall Status:** Major progress has been made. The foundational components, event system, and specialized coordinators are in place. The monolithic `GameCoordinator` has been replaced with specialized coordinators (`MultiplayerHostCoordinator`, `MultiplayerClientCoordinator`, `SinglePlayerGameCoordinator`), and most UI components now follow the declarative pattern with event-based communication.

**Progress by Phase:**

*   **Phase 1: Component Refactoring Foundation & Event Setup**
    *   **Step 1: BaseComponent:** [Completed]
        *   `RefactoredBaseComponent` is implemented and used by new components.
        *   **Recent Update:** `BaseDialog` refactored to extend `RefactoredBaseComponent` for consistent dialog architecture.
    *   **Step 2: Event Setup:** [Completed]
        *   `event-constants.js` and `message-types.js` established and populated.
        *   `event-bus.js` in place with consistent usage across components.
        *   Event documentation added via `@event` tags in docblocks.
    *   **Step 3: MainMenuComponent:** [Completed]
        *   Created (`js/components/main-menu-component.js`) using declarative patterns.
        *   Emits UI events via the `emits` property in the event configuration.
    *   **Step 4: MultiplayerChoiceComponent:** [Completed]
        *   Created (`js/components/multiplayer-choice-component.js`) using declarative patterns.
        *   Handles name input and storage.
        *   Emits UI events (`Events.UI.MultiplayerChoice.HostClicked`, `Events.UI.MultiplayerChoice.JoinClicked`).
    *   **Step 5: Initial Navigation:** [Completed]
        *   Specialized coordinators and `UIManager.js` listen for UI events (`UI.MainMenu.*Clicked`, `UI.MultiplayerChoice.*Clicked`).
        *   Navigation fully event-driven.

*   **Phase 2: Component Logic Migration with Event Bindings**
    *   **Step 6: JoinLobbyComponent:** [Completed]
        *   Created (`js/components/join-lobby-component.js`).
        *   Logic migrated from `GameCoordinator` (submit code, handle game info, confirm join, manage view states).
        *   Uses event-based communication with `MultiplayerClientManager` and `WebRTCManager`.
        *   Event handlers documented with `@event` tags.
    *   **Step 7: HostLobbyComponent:** [Completed]
        *   Created (`js/components/host-lobby-component.js`).
        *   Event handlers for player list updates and starting the game implemented.
        *   Emits appropriate events (`Events.UI.HostLobby.StartGameClicked`, `Events.UI.HostLobby.CancelClicked`).
        *   Event handlers documented with `@event` tags.
    *   **Step 8: MultiplayerGame Split:** [Completed]
        *   `MultiplayerHostGame.js` and `MultiplayerClientGame.js` fully implemented with clear separation of concerns.
        *   Event-based communication between game instances and other components.
        *   Event emitters documented with `@event` tags.
    *   **Step 9: Game Message Handling:** [Completed]
        *   `MultiplayerClientManager.js` handles receiving/processing game messages from host.
        *   `MultiplayerHostManager.js` handles lobby messages and sends game info.
        *   Specialized coordinators handle game-specific logic.
    *   **Step 10: Declarative Event Handling:** [Completed]
        *   All new components use the declarative `initialize()` pattern.
        *   Direct calls to `GameCoordinator` removed, replaced with event-based communication.
        *   **Recent Update:** Improved `CustomQuestionsComponent` with proper PHP-style docblocks and removed empty event handlers for better code clarity.
        *   **Recent Update:** Enhanced `SheetSelectionComponent` docblocks to follow PHP-style standards with proper `@property` and parameter type annotations.
        *   **Recent Update:** Refactored multiple dialogs (`ConfirmationDialog`, `NamePromptDialog`, `PracticeEndDialog`) to use the declarative pattern and consistent docblocks.

*   **Phase 3: GameCoordinator Simplification and Interface Definition**
    *   **Step 11: Coordinator Specialization:** [Completed]
        *   `GameCoordinator.js` deprecated and replaced with specialized coordinators:
            * `SinglePlayerGameCoordinator.js`
            * `MultiplayerHostCoordinator.js`
            * `MultiplayerClientCoordinator.js`
    *   **Step 12: State Management:** [Completed]
        *   Specialized coordinators maintain minimal state relevant to their domain.
        *   Components manage their own internal state.
    *   **Step 13: Event Payloads:** [Completed]
        *   Event payloads defined with consistent structure in `event-constants.js`.
        *   Event documentation added via `@event` tags in docblocks.

*   **Phase 4: Testing, Verification, and Performance Optimization**
    *   **Step 14: Systematic Testing:** [In Progress]
        *   Need to test all game flows (single-player, practice, host, join) to ensure event-driven communication works as expected.
    *   **Step 15: Game State Consistency:** [In Progress]
        *   Need to verify game state consistency across players, especially for multiplayer sync.
    *   **Step 16: Error Handling:** [In Progress]
        *   Need to test edge cases and error scenarios.
        *   **Recent Update:** Simplified error handling in components by removing empty handlers where feedback is handled elsewhere, reducing unnecessary code.
    *   **Step 17: Performance Testing:** [Not Started]
        *   Need to conduct performance testing for multiplayer scenarios.
    *   **Step 18: Event Flow Tracing:** [Not Started]
        *   Need to trace event flows using `EventBus` debug logs.

**Other Notable Changes:**

*   **Controllers Removed:** Old controller files deleted (e.g., `GameAreaController.js`, `MainMenuController.js`, `MultiplayerController.js`).
*   **Dialogs Refactored:** Old dialog classes updated to use the RefactoredBaseComponent architecture and declarative pattern.
    *   `BaseDialog` now extends `RefactoredBaseComponent` for consistent dialog management.
    *   `ConfirmationDialog` refactored to use declarative initialization and event handling.
    *   `NamePromptDialog` updated with PHP-style docblocks and consistent arrow functions.
    *   `PracticeEndDialog` refactored to remove redundant listener management code.
*   **Managers Introduced/Refactored:** `MultiplayerHostManager.js` and `MultiplayerClientManager.js` taking on focused coordination roles.
*   **WebRTCManager Refactored:** Simplified to focus on connection/transport, removing game state and player list management.
*   **Event Documentation:** Added `@event` tags to docblocks across the codebase to document event emission.
*   **HTML Updated:** `index.html` structure aligned with new component views.
*   **File Structure:** Codebase moved from `v2/` to main directories (`js/`, `css/`, etc.).
*   **Code Cleanup:** Removed empty event handlers in `CustomQuestionsComponent` and other components where appropriate, improving code clarity and reducing unnecessary boilerplate.
*   **Documentation Improvement:** Updated docblocks to follow PHP-style standards with proper `@property` and parameter type annotations in multiple components including `CustomQuestionsComponent`, `SheetSelectionComponent`, and dialog components.
*   **Game Classes Refactored:** Improved `PracticeGame.js` with better documentation, consistent event emission patterns, and clear separation of concerns aligned with other game classes.

**Remaining Tasks:**

1. **Refactor Remaining Dialogs:** Continue refactoring the remaining dialog components (`single-player-end-dialog.js`, `multiplayer-end-dialog.js`, etc.) to follow the new pattern.
2. **Event Flow Documentation:** Create a comprehensive document showing event flow between components for key scenarios.
3. **Final GameCoordinator Removal:** Remove or rename the deprecated `GameCoordinator.js` once all functionality is verified.
4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Test all game flows to ensure the refactored architecture works correctly.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Address any performance issues in event-heavy scenarios.
6. **Code Cleanup:** Continue removing empty handlers and redundant code across components.
7. **Documentation Standardization:** Ensure all components follow consistent docblock standards.

**Event Documentation Status:**
- Added `@event` tags to methods in `MultiplayerHostCoordinator.js` and `MultiplayerClientCoordinator.js`.
- Added `@event` tags to methods in `HostLobbyComponent.js` and `JoinLobbyComponent.js`.
- Added `@event` tags to methods in game classes (`MultiplayerHostGame.js`, `MultiplayerClientGame.js`, `SinglePlayerGame.js`, `PracticeGame.js`).
- Added `@event` tags to dialog components that emit events (e.g., `ConfirmationDialog`, `NamePromptDialog`, `PracticeEndDialog`).
- Component handlers use either `@event` tags in docblocks or `emits` property in declarative configurations.
- Improved docblocks in multiple components to follow PHP-style standards, including `CustomQuestionsComponent`, `SheetSelectionComponent`, and various dialogs.
